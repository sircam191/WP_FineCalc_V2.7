# WackPack Fine Calculator 
This is a windows console application for calculating jail times, fines, and codes in a FiveM server.
Please note this program is longer being updated as it was originally created in 2017 when I only understood the very basics of programming. The program works, it is just messy to read and work on. 

For more information on the FiveM server that this program is made for check out the [website](https://www.thewackpackrp.com/) or [Discord server](https://discord.me/thewackpack). 

## Installation

To run the program use the ``FineCalcV3.0.exe`` in the ``wp_FineCalc_v3.0.zip`` file.


## Usage

The ``README.txt`` in the ``wp_FineCalc_v3.0.zip`` file contains FAQ about using the program.
